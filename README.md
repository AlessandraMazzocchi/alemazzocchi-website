## Goals and potential
<br>

My goal for this material is to compare the different years, especially 1918 and 1919, to understand how the Spanish Flu pandemic and the global depression after the Great War impacted the possessions of New York City residents, as well as their ability to move for the summer season. I believe it will take a further research into the other registers of New York City. Some lines of the summer registers report the death of the residence owner, so I find very interesting inquire in those two years, spectators of one of the hardest times the world has ever experienced.
<br>
<br>
Due to time constraints only a small portion of this material has been explored; however, due to the nature of the data, it would be appropriate to consider a collaborative project for future research, maybe continuing this project of comparing 1918 and 1919 mortality due to the Spanish Flu. I believe that the data can disclose important information with a collaborative research, funding, and more time availability.
