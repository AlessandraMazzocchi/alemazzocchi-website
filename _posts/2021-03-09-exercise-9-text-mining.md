Topic modeling has never been a field I excelled at, especially because of the subject of my research and my inability to use the tools. However, using Voyant the applications of Topic Modeling became very clear: mapping and grouping topics in a certain research or thesis. It is interesting to notice how my specific text works better on word counting than topic modeling.
Having a list of items, it is pretty complicated to create an organic set of topics but it was refreshing to see it working in some kind of way with my primary text files.
