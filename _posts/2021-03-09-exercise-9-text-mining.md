Topic modeling has never been a field I excelled at, especially because of the subject of my research and my inability to use the tools. However, using Voyant the applications of Topic Modeling became very clear: mapping and grouping topics in a certain research or thesis. It is interesting to notice how my specific text works better on word counting than topic modeling.
Having a list of items, it is pretty complicated to create an organic set of topics but it was refreshing to see it working in some kind of way with my primary text files.

The nature of this data do not allow for extensive pretty visuals, therefore the Data Report may look extremely plain and similar to a .csv file. However, having a clean, organized list in alphabetical order helps to compare and contrast the different texts once properly cleaned. In my specific case, the sample report use extremely useful for a clean list of the 1918 and 1919 Social Register.
