Interestingly enought, I decided to research on different categories than the Social Register. Due to my personal interest in Augmented Reality, this week was devoted to scout some Wikidata about AR and the topics around it. However, as explained in class, the research has been quite unsuccessful because the field is extremely modern - at least in the way we think about AR.

With no success under my belt, I consulted with Dr Hanley and the method he suggested helped my to expand the research, as well as find the root of what I was looking for. Being a tech tool, AR is categorized as a "system" in Wikidata but unlike Virtual Reality (VR) - which is more popular and more well-known than AR - it has zero (0) instances; it was interesting to understand how Wikidata works, especially with extremely new items like AR or VR.
