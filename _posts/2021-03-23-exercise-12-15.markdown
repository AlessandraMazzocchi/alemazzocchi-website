# What's next?
<br>
Reflecting on the the nature of the Social Register as plain text and data source, I believe that the research potential of these files is infinite, not only as files but as source of information for future projects.
<br>
<br>
Due to time constraints and external factors, my specific research focused more on learning the tools than having a lifelong project, which includes deep cleaning, visuals, graphics, etc. However, sharing a jump start for future research gave this project a sense of completeness. Not only it allowed me to learn the **open source** tools available on the market like Voyant, Google Data Studio, OpenRefine, etc., but also it helps future scholars or aficionado to get a sense of what the Social Register is and what potential has. But where is it the Social Register?
<br>
<br>

## Further research and projects

<br>
The Social Register Summer 1918 and The Social Register Summer 1919 can be found on HathiTrust website.

<br>

Being an early 19th century report, it was extremely complicated to clean and it required 70% of manual cleaning, line by line. Moreover, it has very little to no structure in term of organization of names, addresses, general info, etc. as it can be seen in this brief sample:

Due to the nature of the data, it would be appropriate to consider a collaborative project for future research, maybe continuing this project of comparing 1918 and 1919 mortality due to the Spanish Flu. I believe that the data can disclose important information with a collaborative research, funding, and more time availability.
