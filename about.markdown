# Get to know me

<br>
I am Alessandra Mazzocchi, soon-to-be graduate with a Master’s degree in Digital Humanities, concentration in cross-linguistic communication. I graduated in 2016 with a Bachelor’s degree in Linguistic Mediation from the University of Turin, Italy, double majoring in English and German, minor in French. 
<br>
<br>
Over the past 10 years I gained international experience both in the job market as well as in academia, working in UK and New York City and studying all over Europe to improve my linguistic, communication, and cross-cultural skills. For these reasons my primary career objective is facilitate the interactions between people in the same department, across departments, and across companies, international company included. 
<br>
<br>
I am highly adaptable to different fields, locations, audiences, and teams, as well as individually motivated for solo tasks. Moreover, due to the recent pandemic, I quickly remodeled my teaching and the learning tasks for medium sized classes to improve the online learning experience.
<br>
<br>
Over the years, fast-paced environments and stressful situations became more familiar to manage in shorter time periods, increasing my presence in the working environments I was part of. In addition to my adaptability, I could consistently obtain high-level results under tight deadlines and invent new, creative methods of presenting information and myself, just like this video, which is the product of proficiency in the digital world and a lot of curiosity for unexplored paths.
